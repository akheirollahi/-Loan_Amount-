## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

ðŸ’µ The aim of this project is to develope a robust predictive model for loan amount estimation using various regression techniques.

This app predicts how much of a loan will be granted to an applicant. For this task, I use a dataset from kaggle, which contains historical information about applicants which can be used to predict loan amount. Below are all the columns from the dataset Iâ€™m using here:

- Customer ID,
- Name
- Gender
- Age
- Income (USD)
- Income Stability
- Profession
- Type of Employment
- Location 
- Loan Amount Request (USD)
- Current Loan Expenses (USD)
- Expense Type 1 
- Expense Type 2
- Dependents
- Credit Score
- No. of Defaults
- Has Active Credit Card
- Property ID
- Property Age
- Property Type
- Property Location
- Co-Applicant
- Property Price 
- Loan Sanction Amount (USD)

## ðŸ“ˆ Methods

- Define a Pipeline to handle data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis: 1. Bivariate analysis  2. Multivariate analysis
- Model development
